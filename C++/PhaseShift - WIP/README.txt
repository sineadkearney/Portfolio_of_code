This is a (work in progress) C++ implementation of my PhaseShift java code, which takes a .mid file used in the game "PhaseShift" and outputs a drum tablature.

Some .mid files were throwing exceptions when the file was loaded. I e-mailed the creater of the game, who informed me that the game was written in C++, and I used this as an opportunity to get some more experience writing code in C++.

This code uses the Juce library http://www.juce.com/
