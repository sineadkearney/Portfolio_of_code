Enter a person's IDMB ID into the form, select a profession (eg Actor, Director, Producer, etc) and the program will return a list of films/tv shows that the person has worked on, in order of highest IMDB rating first.

This program was made when I wanted the filmography by an actor, listed by IMDB ratings. However, in the past few months, IMDB have added this functionality to the website themselves, rendering this program obsolete.
