Personal Project:

This program takes a .mid file used by the game PhaseShift (a free PC game, similar to that of Band Hero and Rock Band), and produces tablature for the selected instrument, on the selected difficulty level.
I wrote this program (which builds on code found online) so that I could practice songs in the game at my own pace.
This is still a work-in-progress.

DumpSequence.java is the main  file.

See "The-Donnas.txt" for an example output.
