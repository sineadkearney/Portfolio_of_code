Function argument is an Nx5 matrix where each row defines a point correspondence. The first
three elements of the row define the (X; Y; Z) world coordinates of the point. The fourth and fifth
element of the row define the (x; y) image coordinates of the point.

Using this matrix of correspondences, compute the perpective projection matrix of the camera.
