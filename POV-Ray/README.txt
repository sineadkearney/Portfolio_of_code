University assignment:
Use POV-Ray to create an animated sequence of your choice with the following requirements. The code should make use of commands such as object, difference and union to build at least one complicated object using simpler primitives.

I chose to create a pokéball (from Pokémon), and the animated sequence is the ball opening. The first ("pokeball01.png") and last ("pokeball10.png") frames of the animation are provided.
